# Build a Local Development Environment
Creates a LAMP stack for local web development with Docker Compose. The stack uses CentOS, Apache and PHP.

SSL keys are created for browsing over HTTPS. See the Applications section below for additional installation and setup.

MariaDB/MySQL is turned off by default. See the Applications section below to enable.

## Applications and Setup
Core:
* CentOS 7
* Apache 2.4
* PHP 5.6
* MySQL - Disabled. See the /docker-compose.yml file and uncomment to enable.

Additional installation/setup:
* SSL keys using OpenSSL
* Nano
* Xdebug

## Docker Images
The following Docker images are used:
* centos/httpd-24-centos7
* php:5.6.40-fpm
* mariadb:10.4.2

## Website Files
Web files are mounted from the local file system into /var/www/etc/ in CentOS. Modify the file path in /.env to point to your local website file.

## Running the Environment
Starting the environment:
`docker-compose up`

Stopping the environment:
`ctrl-c` and then `docker-compose down`

## Connecting with your Web Browser
For HTTP connections use:
`http://localhost`

For HTTPS connections use:
`https://localhost`

You can also use a hosts file hack to use a different domain. For example, you could add the following line into your hosts file to connect at `loc.example.com`:

`loc.example.com  127.0.0.1`

## Ports
The following ports are exposed by Apache:
* 80(HTTP)
* 8080 (HTTP)
* 443 (HTTPS)
* 8443 (HTTPS)
